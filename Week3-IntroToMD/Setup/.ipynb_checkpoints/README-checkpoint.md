trp_cage_box defined the box in which the protein is confined.
trp_cage_ions replaced a specified amount of solvent molecules with cations and anions, Na and Cl, respectively.
trp_nvt.edr and trp_npt.edr contain the energy of our system over time at a constant temperature and pressure respectively.
trp_energymin minimized the energy of our system.
The .tpr files are the inputs for the 1-ns production run resulting from the previous steps mentioned.
