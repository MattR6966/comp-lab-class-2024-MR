In this set of calculations we performed the following:
1. We plotted the energy of the TRP-Cage over time to show that it converges.
2. We then set the temperature and pressure of the system with the NVT and NPT equilibrations.
3. From there we were able to measure the density of the TRP cage over the equilibration time.
