2JOF.pdb is a protein data bank file that contains the structural information of our protein i.e. atomic make up and residues.
ions.mdp defines how the ion topology will be made.
npt.mdp and nvt.mdp define the parameters of our equlibration simulations.
em.mdp defines the parameters of our energy minimization.
porse.itp defines the parameters of the force field (i.e. potential energy).
trp_cage.top is the topology created from the equilibration steps.
