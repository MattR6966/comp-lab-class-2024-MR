The data folder contains the sbatch for the production run along with the outputs from the 10ns run.
Gromacs was used to generate a topolgy, define the dimensions of our peridoic boundaries, neutralize our system with Cl anions, minimize the energy, and equilibrate the system. The outputs from these steps were used to run a 10 nanosecond MD simulation.
The .xtc files are the trajectories our systems followed during the simulation.
